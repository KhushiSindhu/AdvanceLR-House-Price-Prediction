## General Information
- #### Background:
 A US-based housing company 'Surprise Housing' has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
 For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
 The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
- #### Business Problem:
 We need to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. We also need to determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

- #### DataSet :
  Data set gathered is collected from the sale of houses in Australia..
